* [Newsletter Subscription App](https://github.com/nicktheperkins/Python-Projects/tree/main/Challenges/File%20Transfer%20Assignment)


### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Newletter Subscription App
This project is also and MVC web application that is meant to store user input for the purpose of communicating with subscribers to a newsletter. It utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data accesss and a Database First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
